# Javascript and the Web

You've now learned how to use Javascript to build programs running in `node`. However, one of the most exciting things we can do with Javascript is to bring web pages alive with interactivity. We can also develop full-blown applications running inside the user browser, while leveraging what we've learned so far about JS to communicate with backend APIs.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
* Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
